# Museum-of-Art-Collection-API
This is WEB422'S final project. It's a pretty barebones site that accesses the Metropolitan Museum of Art's API and displays various types of art pieces when searched for. 

Running it is simple, navigate to the my-app directory execute this command. The site can hosted locally on the localhost:3000 port.
```
npm run dev
```

It uses a React Hooks library called SWR (State While Revalidate) to fetch data from the API and display on an artwork card. Depending on what you search will return and display all artworks that have that keyword in it's name. 

This uses react-bootstrap for the CSS. 

This uses useForm for the search and advanced search component of the site. 

This uses useRouter to dynamically generate and navigate to pages in the site. 

Overall, it's a good reference site for if you want to clone it and modify it for your own uses.
